# java-finance-calculator

#Project description: 

This is a command line app that I created through a Pluralsight Java Project for beginners course.
This program allows users to calculate their net savings, best loan rate,
and monthly mortgage rate. Users are prompted to enter their information into the command line. 
The public utilities class handles exceptions in case the user enters a command that doesn't exist or is incorrect.

##What I Learned:
Creating this program helped me gain a deeper understanding of packages, classes, objects, and constructors in Java.
I also gained a better understanding of type conversion and data types in Java. As I continue to practice the fundamentals of Java and its Object-oriented mechanics, I'm also looking forward to applying Object-Oriented design principles to my apps. 


##Technologies used:
Java, IntelliJ IDEA
